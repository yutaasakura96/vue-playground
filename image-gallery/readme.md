# Image Gallery - Vue.js Project

This project is a simple image gallery built with Vue.js. Users can add, remove, and mark images as favorites. The gallery displays the images in a grid layout, and users can interact with each image through intuitive buttons.

## Features

- **Add Photos**: Users can input an image URL and add it to the gallery.
- **Remove Photos**: Click on an image to remove it from the gallery.
- **Favorite Photos**: Click the star icon to toggle the favorite status of an image.
- **Responsive Design**: The gallery adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Styles the gallery, buttons, and general layout.
- **Vue.js**: Handles the reactivity and logic for adding, removing, and favoriting photos.
- **Normalize.css**: Ensures consistent styling across different browsers.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository or download the `index.html` file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Add new images by entering a valid image URL in the input field.
4. Favorite images by clicking the star icon. Remove an image by clicking on the image itself.

## Vue.js Concepts Used

- **Reactivity**: Uses `ref` for handling the list of photos and the input field for adding new photos.
- **Event Handling**: Methods for adding, removing, and toggling favorite status are bound to user actions.
- **Dynamic Styling**: The favorite button color changes when toggled.
